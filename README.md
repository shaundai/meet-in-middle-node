## Meet In The Middle - Back End

#### Full-Stack Web App connected to Yelp API

React Web App (front-end) with Node/Express proxy server (back-end) connected to Yelp REST API and Google REST API.  Uses TypeScript on the frontend to help catch mistakes early as changes are made.  Testing is done with React Testing Library.

## Purpose

Allows users who are in two different locations to find a location to get together that's in the middle based on latitude and longitude, traffic conditions, and travel time.

My personal goal with this project was to learn and practice with several technologies:
- TypeScript
- React Final Form
- React Testing Library
- Node.js
- REST APIs
